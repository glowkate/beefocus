# H1 beefocus

Beefocus is an Open Source Hardware/ Software Telescope Focuser 
The goal of the project is to create a high quality DIY focuser that's
relatively easy to build and modify.

The project has a working physical prototype and it's been field tested
(and it worked).  TODO.md contains the short term list of future actions.
